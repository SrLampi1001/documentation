Documentation using Docusaurus 

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.  

click [here](https://srlampidocs.web.app/) to see my documentation page.

## Information
This documentation is a complement to the information found in my portfolio from all my projects.  
The projects that are present both inside my portfolio and here, have a clear distinction:
- Docusaurus manages technical information in the projects, there you find what the project is, what is made from, how to use it and ilustrative information.
- Portfolio manages more hands in code information, it expands on the folder structure and names from components, it has an overview in the project and screenshots from the actual code.

### docusaurus
- Some information in my docusaurus documentation page corresponds not to projects but assigments and small activities to get familiarized with the technologies.
